Java program that predicts the chance of a snow day for Grand Blanc Community Schools.

This program reads from the [WJRT school closings webpage](http://abc12.com/weather/closings)
and the [National Weather Service](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.92580&lon=-83.61870).

This project was started in February 2014 as an AP Computer Science A assignment.
An Android version is being developed at [CR96/SnowDayAndroid](https://github.com/cr96/snowdayandroid).
